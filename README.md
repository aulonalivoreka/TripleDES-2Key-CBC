## Triple DES 2-Key CBC Mode Encryption and Decryption

Triple DES (3DES) is a symmetric-key block cipher that applies the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm three times to each data block, enhancing its security compared to single DES. By using two unique keys, Triple DES provides increased protection against brute-force attacks and cryptographic vulnerabilities.
